A03 --> UNIT 4

1. Which is the goal of testing management?
* Find failures before releasing to production.
* Generate possible states for the program.
* Read the code looking for bugs.
* Give work to the developers.

2. The pairwise coverage criteria says that... 
* Test cases must ‘visit’, at least once, every pair of values of two any parameter.
* Every interesting value must be used at least in one test case.
* It’s a generalization of pairwise. Test cases must ‘visit’ all tuples of n elements of any n parameters.
* None of above.

3. Which is not an advantage of mutation testing? 
* A huge number of mutants
* It figures out ambiguities in the source code under testing
* It allows improving a test suite in an iterative process
* It can be used as an indicator of how good or bad is a test suite

4. Test-driven development favors… 
* Low dependency coupling
* Low cohesion
* High dependency coupling
* UDP

5. Who normally perceive a defect or bug? 
* The tester.
* The software engineer.
* The final user.
* All of them are correct.

6. What’s the relationship between a test case and a test suite?
* A test suite is composed by one or more test cases.
* A test case is composed by one or more test cases.
* A test suite is the same that a test case.
* They are not related.

7. What’s the difference between black box or white box testing?
* In the white box we know exactly the internal mechanism of what we are testing, while in the black box not.
* Black box or white box is the same, is only a preference of naming.
* In the black box, inputs are not needed.
* White box is known as functional tests.


8. What’s means the MINIMAX function?
* Minimum time invest of testing and maximum test effectiveness.
* It’s a computer game technique.
* It means covering the largest amount of tests cases as we can.
* All of them are false.

9. What is Acceptance-Behaviour-driven development (ABDD) based on?
* Behaviour-driven development (BDD)
* Databases development (DBD)
* Test-driven development (TDD)
* Error-driven development (EDD)

10. What is an oracle in the context of testing?
* An agent (human or machine) that makes decisions if a program behaves adequately for a given data set
* A very important company
* A mistake made by a person
* A deviation regarding the expected, required behavior of the system

11. Which of the following statements is true?
* White box tests are usually done if the black box one fails.
* In the black box tests all the structure is known
* In the white box tests only the input and the output is what matters
* White box tests are usually done before the black box ones

12. One rule to optimize the cost of the testing tasks in a project is to use as fewer values as possible which…  (Answer the wrong ending of the sentence)
* Are estimated to return true during the evaluation of the assertion condition.
* Can detect the highest number of failures
* Even not detected, it can be assumed further defects won’t appear by using other values.
* Maximize coverage

13. What Test driven development (TDD) consists of?
* Writing first tests and then codify to fulfill those tests
* Writing tests at the last moment
* Writing first the code and then the tests
* This type of development doesn’t exist

14. What is error-guessing in the context of testing management?
* Intuitively, testing engineer proposes concrete values she/he intuits the system can work inappropriately
* Is about guessing who is the worst engineer in the group
* Is about guessing what is the engineer who have written the errors
* This concept doesn’t exist

15. What is the purpose of AETG?
* Generates, in polynomial time, a set of test cases of acceptable size that get pairwise coverage
* Is an AQC Lab testing type
* Is about writing the most complex tests to brute-force what you are trying to test and make the system safer
* Is the acronym of Automatic Efficient Test Gender

16. Mark the wrong assertion about mutation testing
* Compare inputs
* Is Software testing with the existing test suite 
* Generation of copies of the original software with small mutations 
* Validate every mutation plus the original software with the same, previous test suite

17.  What is a defect or a bug?
* An error doing any activity concerning software.
* A mistake made by a person.
* A deviation regarding the expected, required behavior of the system.
* The more number of defects or bugs, the best.

18 Which are the two fold-goals of mutation testing?
* To design new test suites and evaluate quality of the existing test suites.
* To design new test suites and execute them.
* To evaluate quality of existing test suites and improve it.
* To generate tests and mutations.

19. How the set of combinations are generated when using the combination strategy for test cases?
* Computing the Cartesian product of the test values
* Computing the summation of the test values
* Computing the division product of the test values
* Testing only the first three random combinations of the test values

20. Select the false statement about Test Driven Development (TDD):
* They are not used in agile methodologies
* Drives the design and creation of software starting from the tests, what favors low dependency coupling.  
* In TDD tests can be executed at any time to check the current status of the system.  
* It ensures the new code added doesn’t break any part of the system.
