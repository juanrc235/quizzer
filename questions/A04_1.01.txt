Process.
Methodology.
System.
Task.

Which one of these is not a development methodology?
Scrum.
Structure.
Object Oriented.
Conventional.

Which of these options are the correct order of a sequential Software Development?
Requirements, Requirement Analysis, Design, Code/Hacking, Testing, Maintenance.
Requirements, Requirement Analysis, Maintenance, Analysis, Code/Hacking, Design, Testing.
Requirements, Analysis, Testing, Maintenance, Requirement Analysis, Code/Hacking, Design.
Requirements, Analysis, Maintenance, Testing, Code/Hacking, Design, Requirement Analysis.

Which one of these is a characteristic of the Cascade Model Life Cycle?
A stage cannot begin until the previous one has not finished.
It is harder to estimate the final cost of the overall project.
It allows quick iterations, back steps, and quick ending.
The system is being developed in small increments.

Which one of these characteristics is not a desirable for a methodology?
There aren't predefined rules.
Maintenance support.
Total coverage of the development cycle.
Effective Communications.

Which of these statements is not correct to achieve best practices?
A process can be split into one or several techniques.
Following a procedure, one or more products will be generated.
For supporting the application of each techniques, it must require one or more tools.
An artefact is used as an input or generated as an output.

Which is the main characteristic of the Spiral Model?
Prototypes.
It is not very flexible.
You can't go back when you have completed any objective.
You don't care about the risks.

Which of these guidelines is not defined by a Development Methodology?
The life cycle that will be followed.
The steps which is going to be split.
The restrictions which should be applied.
The tools that should be used.

What is the concept of "best practices"?
Proven practices that have been shown to be effective in the experience.
Reference frameworks containing the processes, activities and task involved in the development of software.
The way in which users and Developers can be communicated.
Set of interrelated or interacting activities which transforms inputs into outputs.

Which of these Life Cycle is the most appropriate for an unexperienced software team?
Cascade.
Incremental.
Spiral.
Reused Oriented.

Which is the result of following a procedure?
One or more artefacts.
The completion of a process.
The developed software.
One or more tools.

A set of philosophies, stages, procedures, rules, techniques, tools, documentation, and training concern that are to be used by Information Systems Developers is...
Development Methodology.
Life Cycle.
Process Model.
Standard.

The ISO 12207:2017 Process for Software Life Cycle doesn�t include:
Deal Processes.
Agreement Processes.
Project Organization Processes.
Technik Processes.

Which of these methodologies is not object oriented?
Merise.
Metrica v3 OO.
OMT.
Unified Development Process.

In which way can standards be helpful for an organization.
They propose concepts and best practices that every organization should tailor to its own reality.
They support the applications of techniques.
They release valuable intermediate results to the end user.
They give a global perspective of the way how things are done in the organization.

What we must take in count in the spiral model?
It take some risks because in the next iteration we can have a worst software development.
There are many steps.
To have the greatest number of prototypes in order to have the best version.
It is very difficult.

What defines the ISO standards?
It implements all the specific task in order to do properly and to carry out the best practices.
It defines the different methodologies and the life cycles we want to follow.
It defines the way to do all the process in a technological company.
It has the main goal of each step in a life cycle, in order to know if we can continue with the next phase.

What are we talking about when we define �how we do things� in software development?
Development methodology.
Life Cycle.
Requirement Analysis.
Process Model.

Which of these things is not a characteristic of a development methodology?
It requires a large involvement of the end users.
It can be understood as a set of methods.
A procedure is the way in which users and Developers can get communicated.
It indicates how to obtain the outputs.

Which of these is not a characteristic of a Life Cycle?
It indicates how we develop software.
It indicates what is required to be obtained.
It doesn't indicate how we develop software.
It establishes the processes involved in the commercial exploitation of the software.
