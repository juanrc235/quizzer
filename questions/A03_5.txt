Which is the goal of maintenance management?
* Sustain the capability of the system to provide a service.
* Find failures before releasing to production.
* Solve only the most severe bugs.
* Modify the software.

How many types of maintenance are there?
* Four.
* Infinite, each company does it own one.
* Only one.
* Three.

What are the four types of Maintenance?
* Perfective, corrective, preventive and adaptive.
* Analogy, corrective, digital.
* Old systems one, new systems one.
* User, company and shopping ones.

About the corrective maintenance, the goal is?
* locate and remove defects that potentially may cause failures.
* adapt to environment changes.
* improve or add new functionality because of changes in the requirements of a software system.
* to modify software for improving some properties (e.g., quality, maintainability) without affecting original specification.

About the adaptive maintenance, the goal is?
* adapt to environment changes.
* locate and remove defects that potentially may cause failures.
* improve or add new functionality because of changes in the requirements of a software system.
* to modify software for improving some properties (e.g., quality, maintainability) without affecting original specification.

About the perfective maintenance, the goal is?
* improve or add new functionality because of changes in the requirements of a software system.
* to modify software for improving some properties (e.g., quality, maintainability) without affecting original specification.
* adapt to environment changes.
* locate and remove defects that potentially may cause failures.
 
About the preventive maintenance, the goal is?
* to modify software for improving some properties (e.g., quality, maintainability) without affecting original specification.
* adapt to environment changes.
* locate and remove defects that potentially may cause failures.
* improve or add new functionality because of changes in the requirements of a software system.

Which is the mayor cause of defects leading to corrective maintenance?
* Design/specification fail.
* Logic.
* Error checking.
* User interface.

Which are the two subtypes of perfective maintenance?
* Extension Maintenance and performance maintenance.
* Quality maintenance two times.
* Performance maintenance and quality.
* Performance and magnitude maintenance.

In the adaptative maintenace, the changes can affect to?
* O.S, infrastructure architecture and development environment.
* Only to the operating system.
* The architecture.
* O.S and the used architecture. 

Which is the most expensive maintenance type?
* Perfective
* Corrective.
* Preventive.
* Adaptive.

which maintenance activity needs more effort?
* Implementation.
* Testing.
* Design.
* Analysis.

What is the legacy code?
* Code developed some time ago.
* Outer Space Code.
* Code the need to be developed.
* Useless code.

What is software reengineering?
* Software reengineering makes it possible to carry out the evolutionary maintenance of legacy information systems by assuming risks and save costs.
* Reinvent the wheel.
* The same as reverse engineering.
* None is correct.

What increases the maintainability dramatically?
* Write clean code.
* The money.
* A good working team.
* Write legacy code.

What are the maintenance cost within a project?
* Around a 70%.
* 5%.
* 99%.
* The cost of the maintenance is not dependent of the cost of the project.

Which is most important resource for maintenance?
* The human one.
* The money.
* Knowing COBOL.
* The computers.
